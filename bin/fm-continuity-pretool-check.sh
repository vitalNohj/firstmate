# Claude primary watcher-continuity PreToolUse gate.
#
# This hook is deliberately narrow. It denies only an executed bin/fm-*.sh fleet
# command other than bin/fm-wake-drain.sh, bin/fm-watch-arm.sh, or the
# independently fail-closed bin/fm-teardown.sh, and only when the active primary
# home has task metadata in flight but no identity-matched live watcher holds the
# home lock. Ordinary shell commands, recovery commands, healthy supervision,
# fleet-idle homes, and child worktrees are always allowed.
#
# The existing turn-end guard remains the unchanged final backstop. This gate
# closes the long-turn gap before another fleet mutation, but does not replace or
# weaken the Stop hook.
#
# Input is Claude PreToolUse JSON on stdin. Tests may pass --command directly.
# Malformed transport, malformed or opaque shell, missing jq/Node, a missing
# classifier, or classifier failure all fail open. This compatibility posture
# prevents an uncertain command from becoming a blanket shell block. A deny
# writes Claude's hook decision to stderr only and exits 2, quoting the current
# Claude recovery mechanism from bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh.
# shellcheck disable=SC1091 # Dependencies are resolved from this script's tracked directory.

Usage: fm-continuity-pretool-check.sh [--command <shell-command>]

Reads Claude PreToolUse JSON from stdin unless --command is supplied.
Exits 0 to allow. Exits 2 with a Claude deny object on stderr only when an
unhealthy primary tries to execute a non-recovery firstmate fleet script.
